                It was year zero of the lunar cycle. <br>
                Eagles were coming from seven different skies, landing on a single day to occupy lands previously vacant for centuries. 
                <br>
                <br>They had the smell and shape and spirit of dinosaurs mixed with the still vibrant instincts of wolves.
                They did not speak. The first thing 
                <br>they did after their arrival was to kill every human being
                <br> in those lands except themselves. 
                <br>
                <br>Then they began to breed -- creating many generations of 
                <br>offspring before finally coming into a state where they 
                <br>could talk.
                <br>
                <br>
                As they grew older, they also became more intelligent, learning
                <br> how to work together as tribes and kingdoms. Slowly but surely, they took over the world's surface.
               <br>
                <br> After all this time, however, there is one land that has never been conquered by them. This place is called Earth, and it is ruled by a king who lives far away from the other nations. He is known only as the King.
                No one knows his true name or identity, nor does anyone know what he looks like. All that is known about him is that he rules one country, and that his nation is the last bastion of resistance against the eagle people.
